# Geocomputation

This project was done as a part of my coursework for 2nd year GEOG0030:Geocomputation module. The analysis uses crime data to study drug misuse, its spatial pattern and relation to socio-economic conditions in London, with a particular insight on Tower Hamlets. 

The final report can be found in the `WCYH4.pdf` file.
